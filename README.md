# Bullion Scrapper (metal_scrapper)
[![pre-commit.ci status](https://results.pre-commit.ci/badge/github/CubeVic/metal_scrapper/main.svg)](https://results.pre-commit.ci/latest/github/CubeVic/metal_scrapper/main)

Scrapper for bullion dealers in Taiwan.

The selection of the best deals doesn't follow any expert opinion or popularity of a specific coin or bar. It is focused only on lower premiums (under construction).

>## Warning
>If Someone decided to use the script, be aware I'm not a financial advisor, so do not take the results as such, I check
the robot files, and I follow the restrictions, and, I will lower the scrapping speed to don't overload any dealer's
websites
